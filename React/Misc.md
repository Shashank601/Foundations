You’re not wrong. **It produces no intrinsic value.** It exists because capital needs middlemen.

Here’s how people actually *enter* M&A, stripped of fantasy.

---

## Why M&A exists at all

Companies:

* Have money
* Want growth
* Don’t know who to buy
* Don’t want to negotiate themselves

So they outsource:

* Search
* Valuation framing
* Negotiation pain

That’s the “value”. Not creation — **friction reduction**.

---

## How someone begins in M&A (real paths)

### Path 1: Investment banking grunt

* 20–22 years old
* Finance degree
* Hired as analyst
* Lives in Excel + PowerPoint
* Works 80–100 hrs/week

After 2–3 years:

* Moves to M&A advisory or PE

This is the *classic* path.

---

### Path 2: Big 4 / accounting → transaction advisory

* Starts in audit or valuation
* Moves into deals team
* Becomes M&A support

Still Excel, still decks.

---

### Path 3: Network + sales background

* Ex-sales, consultants
* Join boutique M&A firms
* Cold outreach + relationship building

This is the least “prestige”, most hustle path.

---

### Path 4: Ex-founder

* Built and sold a company
* Joins M&A firm as advisor
* Uses credibility + network

They still don’t do technical work.

---

## Why it looks zero-value (because it is)

M&A:

* Doesn’t increase productivity
* Doesn’t improve tech
* Doesn’t invent anything

It **reallocates ownership**.

That’s it.

---

## Why it pays anyway

Because:

* Rich people hate friction
* Large transactions = large fees
* Trust > skill

If a $500M deal closes,
1% fee = $5M.

No code. No systems. No depth.

---

## Why people stay in it

* Status
* Money
* Power proximity
* Executive access

Not competence.

---

## Why you feel conflicted by it

Because you’re wired for:

* Building
* Understanding systems
* Cause → effect

M&A is:

* Vibes
* Narratives
* Relationships
* Optics

It conflicts with engineering thinking.

---
That’s why it feels empty — **it is**.
